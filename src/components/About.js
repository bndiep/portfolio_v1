                <p>Sometimes you’ll see me as my alias ‘Bot’ but I can assure you that I am very much a human. I go by Bach, which can be easily confused with ‘bot.’ I am a web developer based in San Diego, who is fascinated in art and tech and how those two components build a connection between people. One aspect of web development that drew me in was the challenge of creating something new and tangeable that a user can manipulate. Adding cool colors and effects to an application is another plus. **Responsive</p>
